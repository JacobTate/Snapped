## Overview
Snapped is photo sharing app that you use on vacation. Have you ever been on vacation and witnessed a photo-worthy moment or wished someone caught you finally standing up on that surf board? Now-a-days, everyone has a smart phone in-hand at all times. They often snap terrific photos at the loss of the subject who will likely never see them. With Snapped, you login, upload any photos that you caught of other people and tag the location along with other custom tags to help the subject find their photo when they're browsing Snapped later that evening.
